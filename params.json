While it may be fun to calculate how long that would take...\r\n\r\n### Ways of Defining the Cube\r\n### A Solution\r\n### How to See in Color\r\nThe goal is the use a webcam and OpenCV to scan the cube. We first tried to use photocells and and RGB LED to scan the cube, but there were a number of problems. You can see what progress we did make at <https://github.com/jcoray/ColorSensor>. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCreated by Jakob Coray @jcoray and Gabriel Norris @Labyrinth-Maker.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nTake a look at the README at <https://github.com/jcoray/SolveCube/blob/master/README.md> or shoot us an email.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
